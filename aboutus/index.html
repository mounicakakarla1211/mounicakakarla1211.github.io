<p>Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education.</p>

<p>When people ask Mrs. Obama to describe herself, she doesn’t hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha’s mom.</p>

<p>But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson’s daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons.</p>

<p>A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley &amp; Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life.</p>

<p>After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago’s City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service.</p>

<p>In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university’s first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed.</p>

<p>As First Lady, Mrs. Obama continued her efforts to support and inspire young people.</p>

<div style="float:right"><img src="/img/profile2.jpg" alt="Sridhar"/></div></p>

<p>Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.</p>

<p>With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton’s army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.</p>

<p>After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a groupof churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants.</p>

<p>He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.</p>

<p>President Obama’s years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world’s most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online.</p>

<p>He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009.</p>

<p>President Obama and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia and Sasha.</p>
